# Git LFS Roadmap

This is a high level overview of some of the big changes we want to make for
Git LFS. If you have an idea for a new feature, open an issue for discussion.

## Bugs/Features

* git index issues [#937](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/937)
* `authenticated` property on urls [#960](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/960)
* Use `expires_at` to quickly put objects in the queue to hit the API again to refresh tokens.
* Add ref information to upload request [#969](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/969)
* Accept raw remote URLs as valid [#1085](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/1085)
* use git proxy settings [#1125](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/1125)
* Not following 301 redirect [#1129](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/1129)
* add all lfs.* git config keys to git lfs env output
* Teach `git lfs update` how to update the clean/smudge filter values [#1083](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/pull/1083)
* Support multiple git alternates
* Investigate `git lfs checkout` hardlinking instead of copying files.
* Investigate `--shared` and `--dissociate` options for `git clone` (similar to `--references`)
* Investigate `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` [#1142](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/1142)
* Teach `git lfs install` to use `git config --system` instead of `git config --global` by default [#1177](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/pull/1177)
* Don't allow `git lfs track` to operate on `.git*` or `.lfs*` files [#1099](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/1099)
* Investigate `git -c lfs.url=... lfs clone` usage
* Test that manpages are built and included [#1149](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/pull/1149)
* Update CI to build from source outside of git repo [#1156](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/1156#issuecomment-211574343)
* Teach `git lfs track` and others to warn when `git lfs install` hasn't been run (or auto-install) [#1167](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/1167)

## Upcoming Features

* File locking [#666](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/pull/666)
* Resumable uploads and downloads [#414](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/414)
* Wrapped versions of `git pull` & `git checkout` that optimize without filters
like `git lfs clone`
* Remove non-batch API route in client

## Possible Features

* Binary diffing - reduce the amount of content sent over the wire.
* Client side metrics reporting, so the Git LFS server can optionally track
how clients are performing.
* Pure SSH: full API & transfer support for SSH without redirect to HTTP

## Project Related

These are items that don't affect Git LFS end users.

* CI builds for Windows.
* Automated build servers that build Git LFS on native platforms.
* Automated QA test suite for running release candidates through a gauntlet of
open source and proprietary Git LFS environments.
* Automatic updates of the Git LFS client. [#531](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/issues/531)
