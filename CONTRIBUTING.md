## Releasing

If you are the current maintainer:

* Create a [new draft Release](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/releases/new).
List any changes with links to related PRs.
* Make sure your local dependencies are up to date: `script/bootstrap`
* Ensure that tests are green: `script/test`
* Bump the version in `lfs/lfs.go`, [like this](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/commit/dd17828e4a6f2394cbba8621037199dc28f046e8).
* Build for all platforms with `script/bootstrap -all` (you need Go setup for
cross compiling with Mac, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows support).
* Test the command locally.  The compiled version will be in `bin/releases/{os}-{arch}/git-lfs-{version}/git-lfs`
* Get the draft Release ID from the GitHub API: `curl -in https://api.github.com/repos/github/git-lfs/releases`
* Run `script/release -id {id}` to upload all of the compiled binaries to the
release.
* Publish the Release on GitHub.
