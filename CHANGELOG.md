# Git LFS Changelog

## 3.6.0 (20 November 2024)

This release is a feature release which includes support for multi-stage
authentication with Git credential helpers (requires Git 2.46.0) and
relative worktree paths (requires Git 2.48.0), a new object transfer batch
size configuration option, better path handling when installing on Windows,
more POSIX-compliant hook scripts, and improved performance with sparse
checkouts, partial clones, and Git remotes with large numbers of tags.

Note that the 3.6.x series of Git LFS releases will be the last releases
for which we provide packages or support for versions of any Linux
distribution based on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) or
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (SLES 12).

Note also that the 3.6.x series of Git LFS releases may be the last
releases for which we provide packages or support for versions of any
Linux distribution based on Debian 10 ("buster").

This release is built using Go v1.23 and therefore on macOS systems
requires macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later, and on Windows systems requires
at least Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 (although Windows 8.1 may
suffice).

## 3.4.0 (26 July 2023)

This release is a feature release which includes support for generating
shell scripts for command-line tab-completion of Git LFS commands with
the new `git-lfs-completion(1)` command, providing multiple headers to Git
credential helpers (a new feature as of Git 2.41), and installing Git LFS
with a Git configuration file stored under the XDG configuration path.

Note that this release will be made by a different member of the core
team than the person who performed many of the past releases, and thus
this release will be signed with a different OpenPGP key.  Please follow

## 3.3.0 (30 November 2022)

This release is a feature release which includes package support for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 9 and compatible OSes, experimental support for multiple
remotes, and some command-line helpers for `git lfs push`.

In this release, we no longer include vendored versions of our dependencies in
the repository or the tarballs.  These were a source of noise and bloat, and
users can easily download the required dependencies with Go itself.  Users who
need to continue to vendor the dependencies can use the `make vendor` target.

In addition, we've also switched the documentation to AsciiDoc from
ronn-flavoured Markdown and included the FAQ in the repository.  This means that
the manual pages now render properly in the GitHub web interface and it's also
much easier to create additional formats, such as PDF, by leveraging the ability
of Asciidoctor to convert to DocBook.

It should also be noted that `git lfs migrate import --everything` now processes
all refs that aren't special to Git instead of just branches and tags.  This is
what it was documented to do, but didn't, so we've fixed it.

Finally, please note that future releases may be done by a different member of
the core team than many of the past releases, and thus may be signed by a
different OpenPGP key.  Please follow [the steps in the README to download all
of the keys for the core
team](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#verifying-releases) to verify releases
successfully in the future.

## 3.2.0 (25 May 2022)

This release is a feature release which includes support for machine-readable
formats for a couple more commands, plus the ability to automatically merge
LFS-based text files from the command-line.  It's likely that the merge driver
will see future improvements, but if you have feedback on the design, please use

## 3.1.3 (19 Apr 2022)

This release introduces a security fix for Windows systems, which has been
assigned CVE-2022-24826.

On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a `..exe` file as
well as a file named `git.exe`, and `git.exe` is not found in PATH, the `..exe`
program will be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
Similarly, if the malicious repository contains files named `..exe` and
`cygpath.exe`, and `cygpath.exe` is not found in PATH, the `..exe` program will
be executed when certain Git LFS commands are run.

This security problem does not affect Unix systems.  This is the same issue as
CVE-2020-27955 and CVE-2021-21237, but the fix for those issue was incomplete
and certain options can still cause the problem to occur.

This occurs because on Windows, Go includes (and prefers) the current directory
when the name of a command run does not contain a directory separator, and it
continues to search for programs even when the specified program name is empty.
This has been solved by failing if the path is empty or not found.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source
contributors:

* @yuske for reporting this to us responsibly

### Bugs

* Report errors when finding executables and revise PATH search tests (@chrisd8088)

### Misc

* Update Windows signing certificate SHA hash in Makefile (@chrisd8088)

## 3.1.2 (16 Feb 2022)

This is a bugfix release which fixes a bug in `git lfs install` and some issues
in our CI release processes, including one that prevented arm64 packages for
Debian 11 from being uploaded.

### Bugs

* lfs: add old hook content to the list of old hooks #4878 (@bk2204)

### Misc

* Revert "Merge pull request #4795 from bk2204/actions-checkout-v2" #4877 (@bk2204)
* .github/workflows: install packagecloud gem #4873 (@bk2204)

## 3.1.1 (14 Feb 2022)

This is a bugfix release which fixes a syntax error in the release workflow.

### Misc

* .github: fix syntax error in release workflow #4866 (@bk2204)

## 3.1.0 (14 Feb 2022)

This release is a feature release which includes support for fallback from
Negotiate to Basic authentication, new ARM64 packages for Debian 11, a new
localization infrastructure, and improved netrc support, in addition to various
bug fixes.  In addition, we've addressed a performance regression for `git lfs
migrate import` that was introduced in v3.0.2.

At the moment, there are no translations available, but if you are interested in
contributing to one, please reach out in an issue.  For compatibility with
Windows and to retain the ability to have a single relocatable binary, the
translations are included in the binary at build time.

contributors:

* @donno2048 for improving our error checking
* @howardlyliao for improved netrc support

## 3.0.1 (28 Sep 2021)

This release is a bugfix release which fixes the Windows ARM64 build process and
addresses a regression in support for empty files in pull and fetch.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source
contributors:

* @dennisameling for fixing support for Windows on ARM64

### Bugs

* Fix Windows arm64 release #4647 (@dennisameling)
* fs: specify a file as existing if it's empty #4654 (@bk2204)

## 3.0.0 (24 Sep 2021)

This release is a major new release and introduces several new features, such as
a pure SSH-based protocol, packages for several new OS versions, support for
ARM64 Windows, Git-compatible pattern matching, and locking multiple files on
the command line, among other items.

When connecting over SSH, the first attempt will be made to use
`git-lfs-transfer`, the pure SSH protocol, and if it fails, Git LFS will fall
back to the hybrid protocol using `git-lfs-authenticate`.  Note that no major
forges are known to support the pure SSH protocol at this time.

Because it is a major release, we've made some backwards-incompatible changes.
A (possibly incomplete) list of them is as follows:

* NTLM support has been completely removed, since nobody volunteered to fix
  issues in it.  Users are advised to use Kerberos or Basic authentication
  instead.
* When using an SSH URL (that is, the syntax starting with `ssh://`), the
  leading slash is not stripped off when invoking `git-lfs-authenticate` or
  `git-lfs-transfer`.  This is compatible with the behavior of Git when invoking
  commands over SSH.
* `git lfs fsck` now additionally checks that pointers are canonical and that
  files that are supposed to be LFS files actually are.  It also exits nonzero
  if any problem is found.
* Pattern matching should be stricter and should either match the behavior of
  `.gitattributes` or `.gitignore`, as appropriate.  Deviations from Git's
  behavior will henceforth be treated as bugs and fixed accordingly.
* Git LFS will now write a Git LFS repository format version into the
  repository.  This is designed to allow future extension with incompatible
  changes.  Repositories without this version will be assumed to be version 0.
  Note that this is different from, but modeled on, Git's repository format
  version.
* `git lfs lock` and `git lfs unlock` now handle multiple pathname arguments and
  the JSON format has changed to handle multiple responses.
* The Go package name now contains a version number.  This should have no effect
  on users because we don't provide a stable Go ABI.
* Empty components in `PATH` are no longer treated as the current directory on
  Windows because unintentionally having such empty components is common and the
  behavior was surprising.

## 2.13.3 (26 Mar 2021)

This release fixes two bugs that caused `git lfs prune` to hang, updates some
dependencies to versions which lack a security issue (which did not affect Git
LFS), and adds support for ARM64 builds on macOS.

### Bugs

* lfs: don't invoke diff drivers when pruning repositories #4407 (@bk2204)
* Parse stash log entries parsimonously in prune command #4449 (@chrisd8088)

### Misc

* Darwin ARM64 support #4437 (@bk2204)
* vendor,go.{mod,sum}: update x/net and dependencies #4398 (@chrisd8088)

## 2.13.2 (13 Jan 2021)

This release introduces a security fix for Windows systems, which has been
assigned CVE-2021-21237.

On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat or
git.exe file in the current directory, that program is executed, permitting the
attacker to execute arbitrary code.  This security problem does not affect Unix
systems.  This is the same issue as CVE-2020-27955, but the fix for that issue
was incomplete and certain options can still cause the problem to occur.

This occurs because on Windows, Go includes (and prefers) the current directory
when the name of a command run does not contain a directory separator.  This has
been solved by always using PATH to pre-resolve paths before handing them to Go.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source
contributors:

* @Ry0taK for reporting this to us responsibly

### Bugs

* Use subprocess for invoking all commands (@bk2204)

## 2.13.1 (11 Dec 2020)

This release fixes a bug in our build tooling that prevents our release process
from working properly.  This release is otherwise identical to 2.13.0.

### Misc

* Makefile: don't fail the second time macOS builds are built #4341 (@bk2204)

## 2.13.0 (10 Dec 2020)

This release introduces several new features, such as the `--above` option to
`git lfs migrate import` and support for `socks5h` proxies.  In addition, many
bugs have been fixed and several miscellaneous fixes have been included.

Unless someone steps up to fix and maintain NTLM support, this will be the last
Git LFS release to support NTLM.  See #4247 for more details.  Note that Git LFS
supports Kerberos as well, which is far more secure and may be a viable
replacement in many situations.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source
contributors:

* @EliRibble for adding support for the `--above` option to `git lfs migrate import`
* @andrewshadura for adding support for the `GIT_LFS_SKIP_PUSH` environment variable
* @sinbad for fixing problems with retaining objects used by stashes
* @tklauser for cleaning up our use of error constants in the code

### Features

* Add --above parameter to 'migrate import'. #4276 (@EliRibble)
* Add GIT_LFS_SKIP_PUSH to allow skipping the pre-push hook #4202 (@andrewshadura)

* Add manual pages to release assets #4230 (@bk2204)
* Honor GIT_WORK_TREE #4269 (@bk2204)

### Bugs

* Make git lfs migrate import handle missing extensions #4318 (@bk2204)
* fs: don't panic when using a too-short object ID to push #4307 (@bk2204)
* Fix pattern matching for .gitattributes #4301 (@bk2204)
* config: map missing port to default for HTTP key lookups #4282 (@bk2204)
* tools: use IoctlFileClone from golang.org/x/sys/unix #4261 (@tklauser)
* tools/util_darwin.go: Remove use of direct syscalls #4251 (@stanhu)
* tools: always force a UTF-8 locale for cygpath #4231 (@bk2204)
* prune: fix deleting objects referred to by stashes #4209 (@sinbad)

### Misc

* migrate import: warn about refs on case insensitive file systems #4332 (@larsxschneider)
* Drop obsolete OS support #4328 (@bk2204)
* tools: use ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION const from golang.org/x/sys/windows #4291 (@tklauser)
* pull: gracefully handle merge conflicts #4289 (@bk2204)
* script/upload: avoid using Ruby's URI.escape #4266 (@bk2204)
* add documentation of security bug report process #4244 (@chrisd8088)

## 2.12.1 (4 Nov 2020)

This release introduces a security fix for Windows systems, which has been
assigned CVE-2020-27955.

On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat or
git.exe file in the current directory, that program is executed, permitting the
attacker to execute arbitrary code.  This security problem does not affect Unix

contributors:

* @dawidgolunski for reporting this to us responsibly

### Bugs

* subprocess: avoid using relative program names (@bk2204)

## 2.12.0 (1 Sep 2020)

This release introduces several new features, such as support for the SHA-256
repositories coming in a future version of Git, restored support for Go 1.11,
the ability to read the contents of .lfsconfig from the repository, signed and
notarized binaries on macOS, and pre-built 32-bit ARM binaries on Linux.  In
addition, several bugs have been fixed and miscellaneous fixes included.

Note that macOS releases are now shipped as zip files, not tarballs, since it is
not possible to notarize tarballs.  macOS releases are now also built on macOS,
so `git lfs dedup` should now function.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source
contributors:

* @saracen for adding support for ARM binaries
* @mversluys for improving locking support
* @cccfeng for updating our documentation to make it more readable
* @bluekeyes for improving performance and tracing
* @gertcuykens for adding missing parts of our documentation

## 2.11.0 (8 May 2020)

This release introduces several new features, such as better support for unnamed
local paths and URLs as remotes, support for `submodule.recurse`, exponential

## 2.4.1 (18 May, 2018)

This release fixes a handful of bugs found and fixed since v2.4.0. In
particular, Git LFS no longer panic()'s after invalid API responses, can
correctly run 'fetch' on SHAs instead of references, migrates symbolic links
correctly, and avoids writing to `$HOME/.gitconfig` more than is necessary.

We would like to extend a "thank you" to the following contributors for their
gracious patches:

- @QuLogic fixed an issue with running tests that require credentials
- @patrickmarlier made it possible for 'git lfs migrate import' to work
  correctly with symbolic links.
- @zackse fixed an inconsistency in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- @zanglang fixed an inconsistency in `README.md`

Git LFS would not be possible without generous contributions from the
open-source community. For these, and many more: thank you!

## 2.4.0 (2 March, 2018)

This release introduces a rewrite of the underlying file matching engine,
expands the API to include relevant refspecs for individual requests,
standardizes the progress output among commands, and more.

Please note: in the next MAJOR release (v3.0.0) the semantic meaning behind
`--include` and `--exclude` flags will change. As the details of exactly which
existing patterns will no longer function as previously are known, we will
indicate them here. Any `--include` or `--exclude` patterns used in v2.3.0 or
earlier are expected to work as previously in this release.

This release would not be possible without the open-source community.
Specifically, we would like to thank:

- @larsxschneider: for contributing fixes to the filter operation in `git lfs
  fsck`, and `git lfs prune`, as well as the bug report leading to the
  filepathfilter changes.
- @yfronto: for adding new Linux release targets.
- @stffabi: for adding support for NTLM with SSPI on Windows.
- @jeffreydwalter: for fixing memory alignment issues with `sync/atomic` on
  32-bit architectures.
- @b4mboo: for adding a LFS configuration key to the list of safe configuration
  options.

Without the aforementioned indviduals, this release would not have been
possible. Thank you!

Git LFS v2.3.0 includes performance optimizations for the `git-lfs-migrate(1)`
and `git-clone(1)` commands, new features, bug-fixes, and more.

This release was made possible by contributors to Git LFS. Specifically:

- @aleb: added support for "standalone" transfer agents, for using `rsync(1)`
  and similar with Git LFS.
- @bozaro: added support for custom `.git/lfs/objects` directories via the
  `lfs.storage` configuration option.
- @larsxschneider: fixed a recursive process leak when shelling out to Git,
  added new features to `git lfs ls-files`, extra information in error
  messages used for debugging, documentation changes and more.
- @mathstuf: contributed a documentation change clarifying LFS's handling of
  empty pointer files.
- @rudineirk and @andyneff: updated our release process to build packages for
  fedora/26.
- @ssgelm: ensured that LFS is able to be released on Ubuntu Universe.

To everyone who has contributed to this or previous releases of Git LFS: Thank
you!

## 2.2.0 (27 June, 2017)

Git LFS v2.2.0 includes bug fixes, minor features, and a brand new `migrate`
command. The `migrate` command rewrites commits, converting large files from
Git blobs to LFS objects. The most common use case will fix a git push rejected
for having large blobs:

```
$ git push origin master
# ...
remote: error: file a.psd is 1.2 gb; this exceeds github's file size limit of 100.00 mb
to github.com:ttaylorr/demo.git
 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:ttaylorr/demo.git'

$ git lfs migrate info
*.psd   1.2 GB   27/27 files(s)  100%

$ git lfs migrate import --include="*.psd"
migrate: Sorting commits: ..., done
migrate: Rewriting commits: 100% (810/810), done
  master        f18bb746d44e8ea5065fc779bb1acdf3cdae7ed8 -> 35b0fe0a7bf3ae6952ec9584895a7fb6ebcd498b
migrate: Updating refs: ..., done

$ git push origin
Git LFS: (1 of 1 files) 1.2 GB / 1.2 GB
# ...
To github.com:ttaylorr/demo.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

The `migrate` command has detailed options described in the `git-lfs-migrate(1)`
man page. Keep in mind that this is the first pass at such a command, so we
expect there to be bugs and performance issues (especially on long git histories).
Future updates to the command will be focused on improvements to allow full
LFS transitions on large repositories.

vulnerability is only exploitable if an attacker has write access to your
repository, or you clone a repository with a `.lfsconfig` file containing that
string.

## 2.0.0 (1 March, 2017)

Git LFS v2.0.0 brings a number of important bug fixes, some new features, and
a lot of internal refactoring. It also completely removes old APIs that were
deprecated in Git LFS v0.6.

### Locking

File Locking is a brand new feature that lets teams communicate when they are
working on files that are difficult to merge. Users are not able to edit or push
changes to any files that are locked by other users. While the feature has been
in discussion for a year, we are releasing a basic Locking implementation to
solicit feedback from the community.

### Transfer Queue

LFS 2.0 introduces a new Git Scanner, which walks a range of Git commits looking
for LFS objects to transfer. The Git Scanner is now asynchronous, initiating
large uploads or downloads in the Transfer Queue immediately once an LFS object
is found. Previously, the Transfer Queue waited until all of the Git commits
have been scanned before initiating the transfer. The Transfer Queue also
automatically retries failed uploads and downloads more often.

### Deprecations

Git LFS v2.0.0 also drops support for the legacy API in v0.5.0. If you're still
using LFS servers on the old API, you'll have to stick to v1.5.6.

### Features

* Mid-stage locking support #1769 (@sinbad)

* commands: convert push, pre-push to use async gitscanner #1812 (@ttaylorr)
* tq: prioritize transferring retries before new items #1758 (@ttaylorr)
