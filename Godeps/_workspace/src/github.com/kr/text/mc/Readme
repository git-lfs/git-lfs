Command mc prints in multiple columns.

  Usage: mc [-] [-N] [file...]

Mc splits the input into as many columns as will fit in N
print positions. If the output is a tty, the default N is
the number of characters in a terminal line; otherwise the
default N is 80. Under option - each input line ending in
a colon ':' is printed separately.
