# Git Large File Storage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.io/adminxax/git-lfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.io/adminxax/git-lfs)

Git LFS is a command line extension and [specification](docs/spec.md) for
managing large files with Git. The client is written in Go, with pre-compiled
binaries available for Mac, Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Check out the
[Git LFS website][page] for an overview of features.

## Getting Started

You can install Git LFS in several different ways, depending on your setup and
preferences.

* Linux users can install Debian or RPM packages from [PackageCloud](https://github.io/adminxax/git-lfs/install).
* Mac users can install from [Homebrew](https://github.com/adminxax/homebrew) with `brew install git-lfs`.
* Windows users can install from [Chocolatey](https://adminxax.chocolatey.io/) with `choco install git-lfs.install`.
* [Binary packages are available][rel] for Windows, Mac, Linux, and FreeBSD.
* You can build it with Go 1.5+. See the [Contributing](./MOBILE.md) for instructions.

Note: Git LFS requires Git v1.8.2 or higher.

One installed, you need to setup the global Git hooks for Git LFS. This only
needs to be run once per machine.

```bash
$ git lfs install
```

Now, it's time to add some large files to a repository. The first step is to
specify file patterns to store with Git LFS. These file patterns are stored in
`.gitattributes`.

```bash
$ mkdir large-repo
$ cd large-repo
$ git init

# Add all zip files through Git LFS
$ git lfs track "*.zip"
```

Now you're ready to push some commits:

```bash
$ git add my.zip
$ git commit -m "add zip"
```

You can confirm that Git LFS is managing your zip file:

```bash
$ git lfs ls-files
my.zip
```

Once you've made your commits, push your files to the Git remote:

```bash
$ git push origin master
Sending my.zip

## Need Help?

You can get help on specific commands directly:

```bash
$ git lfs help <subcommand>
```

The [official documentation](docs) has command references and specifications for
the tool. You can ask questions in the [Git LFS chat room][chat], or [file a new
issue][ish]. Be sure to include details about the problem so we can
troubleshoot it.

1. Include the output of `git lfs env`, which shows how your Git environment
is setup.
2. Include `GIT_TRACE=1` in any bad Git commands to enable debug messages.
3. If the output includes a message like `Errors logged to /adminxax.github.io/.git/lfs/objects/logs/*.log`,
throw the contents in the issue, or as a link to a Gist or paste site.
