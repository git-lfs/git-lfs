# Git Large File Storage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/github/git-lfs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/git-lfs)

Git LFS is a command line extension and [specification](docs/spec.md) for
managing large files with Git. The client is written in Go, with pre-compiled
binaries available for Mac, Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Check out the
[Git LFS website][page] for a high level overview of features.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on working on Git LFS and
sending patches. Related projects are listed on the [Implementations wiki
page][impl]. You can chat with the team at: https://gitter.im/github/git-lfs

## Getting Started

Download the [latest client][rel] and run the included install script.  The
installer should run `git lfs init` for you, which sets up Git's global
configuration settings for Git LFS.

Note: Git LFS requires Git v1.8.2 or higher.

### Configuration

Git LFS uses `.gitattributes` files to configure which are managed by Git LFS.
Here is a sample one that saves zips and mp3s:

    $ cat .gitattributes
    *.mp3 filter=lfs -text
    *.zip filter=lfs -text

Git LFS can manage `.gitattributes` for you:

    $ git lfs track "*.mp3"
    Tracking *.mp3

    $ git lfs track "*.zip"
    Tracking *.zip

    $ git lfs track
    Listing tracked paths
        *.mp3 (.gitattributes)
        *.zip (.gitattributes)

    $ git lfs untrack "*.zip"
    Untracking *.zip

    $ git lfs track
    Listing tracked paths
        *.mp3 (.gitattributes)

### Pushing commits

Once setup, you're ready to push some commits:

    $ git add my.zip
    $ git commit -m "add zip"

You can confirm that Git LFS is managing your zip file:

    $ git lfs ls-files
    my.zip

Once you've made your commits, push your files to the Git remote:

    $ git push origin master
    Sending my.zip

and [man pages](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/tree/master/docs/man).

### Moving existing file formats to LFS

Moving to LFS does not have to be hard! The Windows batch script below can be used to migrate one file format at a time. Simply create a batch file with the source below inside the root of your repository, and call it as follows: `MyBatchFile.bat exe`, in order to move all ".exe" files to LFS!

    $ SET file_extension=%~1
    :: Remove all the desired files from VCS, but keep them locally
    git rm --cached "*.%file_extension%"
    git commit -m "Removed %file_extension% format from the repository"
    :: Tell LFS to track this format, has to be done before the files are added
    git lfs track "*.%file_extension%"
    :: Add to LFS!
    git add "*.%file_extension%"
    git commit -m "Added %file_extension% format to LFS"â€‹
    
Note that the example above does *not* remove usage of the file format from history, see [Remove Sensitive Data](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/) for more information on that.
