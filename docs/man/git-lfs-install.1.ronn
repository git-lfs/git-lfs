git-lfs-install(1) -- Install Git LFS configuration.
========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`git lfs install` [options]

## DESCRIPTION

Perform the following actions to ensure that Git LFS is setup properly:

* Set up the clean and smudge filters under the name "lfs" in the global Git
  config.
* Install a pre-push hook to run git-lfs-pre-push(1) for the current repository,
  if run from inside one. If "core.hooksPath" is configured in any Git
  configuration (and supported, i.e., the installed Git version is at least
  2.9.0), then the pre-push hook will be installed to that directory instead.

## OPTIONS

Without any options, `git lfs install` will only setup the "lfs" smudge and clean
filters if they are not already set.

* `--force`:
    Sets the "lfs" smudge and clean filters, overwriting existing values.
* `--local`:
    Sets the "lfs" smudge and clean filters in the local repository's git
    config, instead of the global git config (~/.gitconfig).
* `--manual`:
    Print instructions for manually updating your hooks to include git-lfs
    functionality. Use this option if `git lfs install` fails because of existing
    hooks and you want to retain their functionality.
* `--system`:
    Sets the "lfs" smudge and clean filters in the system git config, e.g. /etc/gitconfig
    instead of the global git config (~/.gitconfig).
* `--skip-smudge`:
    Skips automatic downloading of objects on clone or pull. This requires a
    manual "git lfs pull" every time a new commit is checked out on your
    repository.
* `--skip-repo`:
    Skips setup of the local repo; use if you want to install the global lfs
    filters but not make changes to the current repo.
