git-lfs-migrate(1) - Migrate history to or from git-lfs
=======================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`git lfs migrate` <mode> [options] [--] [branch ...]

## MODES

* `info`
    Show information about repository size.

* `import`
    Convert large Git objects to LFS pointers.

## OPTIONS

* `-I` <paths> `--include=`<paths>:
    See [INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE].

* `-X` <paths> `--exclude=`<paths>:
    See [INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE].

* `--include-ref`=<refname>:
    See [INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE (REFS)].

* `--exclude-ref`=<refname>:
    See [INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE (REFS)].

* `--skip-fetch`:
    Assumes that the known set of remote references is complete, and should not
    be refreshed when determining the set of "un-pushed" commits to migrate. Has
    no effect when combined with `--include-ref` or `--exclude-ref`.

* `--everything`:
    See [INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE (REFS)].

* [branch ...]:
    Migrate only the set of branches listed. If not given, `git-lfs-migrate(1)`
    will migrate the currently checked out branch.

    References beginning with '^' will be excluded, whereas branches that do not
    begin with '^' will be included.

    If any of `--include-ref` or `--exclude-ref` are given, the checked out
    branch will not be appended, but branches given explicitly will be appended.

### INFO

The 'info' mode has these additional options:

* `--above=<size>`
    Only count files whose individual filesize is above the given size. 'size'
    may be specified as a number of bytes, or a number followed by a storage
    unit, e.g., "1b", "20 MB", "3 TiB", etc.

    If a set of files sharing a common extension has no files in that set whose
    individual size is above the given `--above` no files no entry for that set
    will be shown.

* `--top=<n>`
    Only include the top 'n' entries, ordered by how many total files match the
    given pathspec.

* `--unit=<unit>`
    Format the number of bytes in each entry as a quantity of the storage unit
    provided. Valid units include:
      * b, kib, mib, gib, tib, pib - for IEC storage units
      * b, kb, mb, gb, tb, pb - for SI storage units

    If a --unit is not specified, the largest unit that can fit the number of
    counted bytes as a whole number quantity is chosen.

### IMPORT

The 'import' mode migrates large objects present in the Git history to pointer
files tracked and stored with Git LFS. It supports all the core 'migrate'
options and these additional ones:

* `--verbose`
    Print the commit oid and filename of migrated files to STDOUT.

* `--object-map=<path>`
    Write to 'path' a file with the mapping of each rewritten commits. The file
    format is CSV with this pattern: `OLD-SHA`,`NEW-SHA`

* `--no-rewrite`
    Migrate large objects to Git LFS in a new commit without rewriting git
    history. Please note that when this option is used, the `migrate import`
    command will expect a different argument list, specialized options will
    become available, and the core `migrate` options will be ignored. See
    [IMPORT (NO REWRITE)].

If `--no-rewrite` is not provided and `--include` or `--exclude` (`-I`, `-X`,
respectively) are given, the .gitattributes will be modified to include any new
filepath patterns as given by those flags.

If `--no-rewrite` is not provided and neither of those flags are given, the
gitattributes will be incrementally modified to include new filepath extensions
as they are rewritten in history.

### IMPORT (NO REWRITE)

The `import` mode has a special sub-mode enabled by the `--no-rewrite` flag.
This sub-mode will migrate large objects to pointers as in the base `import`
mode, but will do so in a new commit without rewriting Git history. When using
this sub-mode, the base `migrate` options, such as `--include-ref`, will be
ignored, as will those for the base `import` mode. The `migrate` command will
also take a different argument list. As a result of these changes,
`--no-rewrite` will only operate on the current branch - any other interested
branches must have the generated commit merged in.

The `--no-rewrite` sub-mode supports the following options and arguments:

* `-m <message> --message=<message>`
    Specifies a commit message for the newly created commit.

* [file ...]
    The list of files to import. These files must be tracked by patterns
    specified in the gitattributes.

If `--message` is given, the new commit will be created with the provided
message. If no message is given, a commit message will be generated based on the
file arguments.

## INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE

You can configure Git LFS to only migrate tree entries whose pathspec matches
the include glob and does not match the exclude glob, to reduce total migration
time or to only migrate part of your repo. Specify multiple patterns using the
comma as the delimiter.

Pattern matching is done as given to be functionally equivalent to pattern
matching as in .gitattributes.

## INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE (REFS)

You can configure Git LFS to only migrate commits reachable by references
include by `--include-ref` and not reachable by `--exclude-ref`.

        D---E---F
       /         \
  A---B------C    refs/heads/my-feature
   \          \
    \          refs/heads/master
     \
      refs/remotes/origin/master

In the above configuration, the following commits are reachable by each ref:

refs/heads/master:         C, B, A
refs/heads/my-feature:     F, E, D, B, A
refs/remote/origin/master: A

The following configuration:

  --include-ref=refs/heads/my-feature
  --include-ref=refs/heads/master
  --exclude-ref=refs/remotes/origin/master

Would, therefore, include commits: F, E, D, C, B, but exclude commit A.

The presence of flag `--everything` indicates that all local references should be
migrated.

## EXAMPLES

### Migrate unpushed commits

The migrate command's most common use case is to convert large git objects to
LFS before pushing your commits. By default, it only scans commits that don't
exist on any remote, so long as the repository is non-bare.

First, run `git lfs migrate info` to list the file types taking up the most
space in your repository.

```
$ git lfs migrate info
migrate: Fetching remote refs: ..., done
migrate: Sorting commits: ..., done
migrate: Examining commits: 100% (1/1), done
*.mp3  	284 MB	  1/1 files(s)	100%
*.pdf  	42 MB 	  8/8 files(s)	100%
*.psd  	9.8 MB	15/15 files(s)	100%
*.ipynb	6.9 MB	  6/6 files(s)	100%
*.csv  	5.8 MB	  2/2 files(s)	100%
```

Now, you can run `git lfs migrate import` to convert some file types to LFS:

```
$ git lfs migrate import --include="*.mp3,*.psd"
migrate: Fetching remote refs: ..., done
migrate: Sorting commits: ..., done
migrate: Rewriting commits: 100% (1/1), done
  master	d2b959babd099fe70da1c1512e2475e8a24de163 -> 136e706bf1ae79643915c134e17a6c933fd53c61
migrate: Updating refs: ..., done
```

### Migrate local history

You can also migrate the entire history of your repository:

```
# Check for large files in your local master branch
$ git lfs migrate info --include-ref=master

# Check for large files in every branch
$ git lfs migrate info --everything
```

The same flags will work in `import` mode:

```
# Convert all zip files in your master branch
$ git lfs migrate import --include-ref=master --include="*.zip"

# Convert all zip files in every local branch
$ git lfs migrate import --everything --include="*.zip"
```

Note: This will require a force push to any existing Git remotes.

### Migrate without rewriting local history

You can also migrate files without modifying the existing history of your respoitory:

Without a specified commit message: 
```
    git lfs migrate import --no-rewrite test.zip *.mp3 *.psd
```
With a specified commit message:
```
    git lfs migrate import --no-rewrite -m "Import .zip, .mp3, .psd files" \
      test.zip *.mpd *.psd
```
