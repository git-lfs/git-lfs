== NAME

git-lfs - Work with large files in Git repositories

== SYNOPSIS

`git lfs` <command> [<args>]

== DESCRIPTION

Git LFS is a system for managing and versioning large files in
association with a Git repository. Instead of storing the large files
within the Git repository as blobs, Git LFS stores special "pointer
files" in the repository, while storing the actual file contents on a
Git LFS server. The contents of the large file are downloaded
automatically when needed, for example when a Git branch containing the
large file is checked out.

Git LFS works by using a "smudge" filter to look up the large file
contents based on the pointer file, and a "clean" filter to create a new
version of the pointer file when the large file's contents change. It
also uses a `pre-push` hook to upload the large file contents to the Git
LFS server whenever a commit containing a new large file version is
about to be pushed to the corresponding Git server.

== COMMANDS

Like Git, Git LFS commands are separated into high level ("porcelain")
commands and low level ("plumbing") commands.

== EXAMPLES

To get started with Git LFS, the following commands can be used.

. Setup Git LFS on your system. You only have to do this once per user
account:
+
....
git lfs install
....
. Choose the type of files you want to track, for examples all `ISO`
images, with git-lfs-track(1):
+
....
git lfs track "*.iso"
....
. The above stores this information in gitattributes(5) files, so that
file needs to be added to the repository:
+
....
git add .gitattributes
....
. Commit, push and work with the files normally:
+
....
git add file.iso
git commit -m "Add disk image"
git push
....
