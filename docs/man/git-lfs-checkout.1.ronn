git-lfs-checkout(1) -- Update working copy with file content if available
=========================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`git lfs checkout` <filespec>...

## DESCRIPTION

This command is deprecated, and should be replaced with `git checkout`.

Try to ensure that the working copy contains file content for Git LFS objects
for the current ref, if the object data is available. Does not download any
content, see git-lfs-fetch(1) for that. 

Checkout scans the current ref for all LFS objects that would be required, then
where a file is either missing in the working copy, or contains placeholder
pointer content with the same SHA, the real file content is written, provided
we have it in the local store. Modified files are never overwritten.

Filespecs can be provided as arguments to restrict the files which are updated.

## EXAMPLES

* Checkout all files that are missing or placeholders

  `git lfs checkout`

* Checkout a specific couple of files

  `git lfs checkout path/to/file1.png path/to.file2.png`
